						        <li>Expedited:  2-3 business days</li>
								<li>Express: 1-2 business days</li>
							</ul>

							<p>The cost for shipping is based upon total order amount. An additional shipping surcharge may apply to some items due to their size and weight.</p>
							<p>Please note, at this time we are unable to ship to P.O. Box addresses.</p>
							<p>We are unable to ship to international locations at this time.</p>

							<p>Southern Supply Company reserves the right to hold any order for a security review. If your order is affected, you will be notified within two business days.</p>

							<p>Individual products qualifying for Free Shipping will be identified with “Item(s) qualify for Free Standard Shipping”. Your shipping amount total will not reflect items that qualify for free shipping. If you select a shipping method other than the free offer method, shipping charges will apply.</p>

							<h4>Items Shipped Directly from Vendor</h4>
								<p>Items identified with “Ships Directly from Vendor” will be sent from the product manufacturer/vendor and will be delivered within 10 business days via standard shipping.

						<h2 class="title">Tax Policy</h2>
					        
					        <p>All Items sold by Southern Supply Company, Inc and shipped to destinations are subject to tax.</p>

							<p>No sales tax is charged when purchasing gift cards; however, purchases paid for with gift cards may be subject to tax.</p>
							
							<div class="marT-20"></div>
							<h4>How Sales Tax is Calculated</h4>

								<p>If an item is subject to sales tax in the state to which the order is shipped, tax is generally calculated on the total selling price of each individual item. In accordance with state tax laws, the total selling price of an item will generally include item-level shipping and handling charges, item-level discounts, gift-wrap charges, and an allocation of order-level shipping and handling charges and order-level discounts.</p>
								<p>The amount of tax charged on your order will depend upon many factors including Identity of the seller, type of item purchased, and destination of the shipment. Factors can change between the time you place an order and the time of credit card charge authorization, which could affect the calculation of sales taxes. The amount appearing on your order as Estimated Tax may differ from the sales taxes ultimately charged.</p>
