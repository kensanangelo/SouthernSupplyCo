		<h2>Tax Policy</h2>
        
        <p>All Items sold by Southern Supply Company, Inc and shipped to destinations are subject to tax.</p>

<p>No sales tax is charged when purchasing gift cards; however, purchases paid for with gift cards may be subject to tax.</p>

<p>How Sales Tax is Calculated</p>

<p>If an item is subject to sales tax in the state to which the order is shipped, tax is generally calculated on the total selling price of each individual item. In accordance with state tax laws, the total selling price of an item will generally include item-level shipping and handling charges, item-level discounts, gift-wrap charges, and an allocation of order-level shipping and handling charges and order-level discounts.</p>

<p>The amount of tax charged on your order will depend upon many factors including Identity of the seller, type of item purchased, and destination of the shipment. Factors can change between the time you place an order and the time of credit card charge authorization, which could affect the calculation of sales taxes. The amount appearing on your order as Estimated Tax may differ from the sales taxes ultimately charged.</p>

<h2>Return policy</h2>
	
<p>Most merchandise can be returned within 90 days of purchase unless noted in our Return Policy Exceptions.  Refunds will be issued to the original form of payment (credit card, Pay Pal, etc.).

Please note bundled items need to be returned with all components for a full refund.</p>
